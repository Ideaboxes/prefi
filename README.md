#Halted
Facebook's recent changes to their API makes such concept impossible, because we can no longer get friends' likes and actions: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/changelog#v2_0_permissions
## ~~Prefi~~
Repo for [favibot idea](https://github.com/Ideaboxes/proposal/blob/master/favibot.md). Prefi sounds more friendly.
### ~~Why?~~
Keep track of/find out who likes what

### ~~What?~~
- Suggest gift items :gift:
- Suggest colors :rainbow:
- List no-no items :no_good:

### ~~How?~~
- Crawl facebook likes
- Crawl and analyse facebook status/tweets?
- Compare and extrapolate from similar profiles?

### ~~Dev~~
A Facebook app has been configured to allow prefi.keang.me, so:
- Add `127.0.0.0 pref.keang.me` to `/etc/hosts`
- Server a local pref.keange.me
